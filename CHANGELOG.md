## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Forecasting core** — custom PyTorch LSTM with optional additive attention and
  point/quantile heads; direct multi-horizon prediction in delta (change-from-last) space.
- **Reversible transforms** — leakage-safe `Detrend`, `Deseason`, `RobustScale`,
  `StandardScale`, `Log`, `Difference`, composed via `Transformer`/`Reverter`; correct
  inversion at future positions.
- **Public API** — `Forecaster` (test-set benchmarking, conformal intervals, transfer
  learning) and `Pipeline` composer mirroring the scalecast ergonomics.
- **Probabilistic forecasting** — split-conformal static intervals and backtest
  residual-matrix dynamic (horizon-aware) intervals.
- **Baselines** — Naive, Drift, Seasonal-Naive, ARIMA, ETS for honest benchmarking.
- **Retrieval-augmented forecasting (RAG)** — z-normalised analog-window index (FAISS with
  NumPy fallback) producing per-timestep analog feature channels.
- **Claude AI layer** — natural-language insights, structured LLM-assisted tuning, and a
  RAG chat assistant; all degrade gracefully with no API key.
- **Finance features** — log-returns, volatility, RSI, MACD, Bollinger, calendar & Fourier.
- **Surfaces** — FastAPI service (`/forecast`, `/backtest`, `/insights`, `/chat`,
  `/transfer`, `/health`), Streamlit dashboard, and a CLI (`lstm-forecast`).
- **Packaging & ops** — pip-installable package with optional extras, Dockerfiles +
  compose, GitHub Actions CI (lint/type/test matrix + image build), pre-commit, mkdocs docs,
  runnable examples for the article's five capabilities, and a model card.
